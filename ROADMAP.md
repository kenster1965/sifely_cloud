# üó∫Ô∏è Sifely Cloud Integration ‚Äì Roadmap

This document outlines planned features, improvements, and ideas for the future development of the Sifely Cloud integration.

## üß≠ Planned Features / Fixes

Maybe:
- [ ] For expired credentials, add async_step_reauth() support so the user can re-authenticate without removing the integration?
- [ ] Add a /diagnostics endpoint for easy bug reporting via the HA UI?
- [ ] Validate and sort lock history by timestamp (to guard against out-of-order entries)?
- [ ] Button to download the latest lock history to a .csv file via the www/ folder, or maybe email?
- [ ] Persist cloud error status.
- [ ] Lock schedule viewer/editor
- [ ] Doorbell / touch event detection (if supported)
- [ ] Configurable polling intervals from the UI
- [ ] I think the better lock version is available via lock device details need to investigate.

Thinking about:
- [ ] Rename locks from Home Assistant UI.
- [ ] Show lock timezone settings.
- [ ] Lock configuration sync (from app ‚Üí HA). ( Confirm)
- [ ] Optional persistent notification on tamper alert.
- [ ] Push notification integration (via HA Notify service).
- [ ] Chart view of lock usage over time?
- [ ] History trend analysis in UI (via custom panel or HACS card).
- [ ] Option to disable polling (manual update only? or from UI)
- [ ] Better handling for gateway busy/timeout edge cases.
- [ ] QR Code-based setup via UI (This would be cool)
