## üß≠ Planned Features / Fixes

Maybe:
- [ ] For expired credentials, add async_step_reauth() support so the user can re-authenticate without removing the integration?
- [ ] Add a /diagnostics endpoint for easy bug reporting via the HA UI?
- [ ] Validate and sort lock history by timestamp (to guard against out-of-order entries)?
- [ ] Button to download the latest lock history to a .csv file via the www/ folder, or maybe email?
- [ ] Persist cloud error status.
- [ ] Update translations with any text out there.
- [ ] Look at UUID, token, or hashed identifier from web and find user name for history file.
- [ ] Lock schedule viewer/editor
- [ ] Doorbell / touch event detection (if supported)
- [ ] Configurable polling intervals
- [ ] Auto-restore lock history from cloud on reboot

Thinking about:
- [ ] Rename locks from Home Assistant UI.
- [ ] Show lock timezone settings.
- [ ] Lock configuration sync (from app ‚Üí HA). ( Confirm)
- [ ] Optional persistent notification on tamper alert.
- [ ] Push notification integration (via HA Notify service).
- [ ] Chart view of lock usage over time.
- [ ] History trend analysis in UI (via custom panel or HACS card).
- [ ] Option to disable polling (manual update only? )
- [ ] Better handling for gateway busy/timeout edge cases.
- [ ] QR Code-based setup via UI (This would be cool)
