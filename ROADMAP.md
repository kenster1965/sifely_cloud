This document outlines planned features, improvements, and ideas for the future development of the Sifely Cloud integration.

## 🧭 Planned Features / Fixes

Maybe:
- [ ] For expired credentials, add async_step_reauth() support so the user can re-authenticate without removing the integration?
- [ ] Button to download the latest lock history to a .csv file via the www/ folder, or maybe email?
- [ ] Persist cloud error status.
- [ ] Lock schedule viewer/editor.
- [ ] Doorbell / touch event detection (if supported).
- [ ] Configurable polling intervals disable polling (manual update only? or from UI)

Thinking about:
- [ ] Rename locks from Home Assistant UI, if possible.
- [ ] Show lock timezone settings.
- [ ] Optional persistent notification on tamper alert.
- [ ] QR Code-based setup via UI (This would be cool)
