TODO:
Start writing the readme
Add docstriongs

Add auto versioning

Reauthentication Flow
For expired credentials, you could add async_step_reauth() support so the user can re-authenticate without removing the integration.

Diagnostics Support
Add a /diagnostics endpoint for easy bug reporting via the HA UI.

Data validation for history
Validate and sort lock history by timestamp (to guard against out-of-order entries).

CSV Export Support
Optionally create a button to download the latest lock history to a .csv file via the www/ folder.


(Optional) Persist cloud error status
If you want the cloud error to survive reboot until cleared, you can store it in hass.data[DOMAIN] or config options. This is optional unless diagnostics need to be retained.

Would you like me to now generate the diagnostic sensor (cloud_error_sensor.py) and wire it up in sensor.py and __init__.py?


GIT add know isshies, and version
