## 🔧 Installation
### Manual Installation
1. Using the tool of choice open the directory (folder) for your HA configuration (where you find configuration.yaml).
2. If you do not have a custom_components directory (folder) there, you need to create it.
3. In the custom_components directory (folder) create a new folder called `sifely_cloud`.
4. Download all the files from the `custom_components/sifely_cloud/` directory (folder) in this repository.
5. Place the files you downloaded in the new directory (`sifely_cloud`) you created.
6. Restart Home Assistant.
7. Navigate to **Settings > Devices & Services > Integrations**.

- Maximum number of retries
- History record type labels
- Default limits for entities and diagnostics
- Error thresholds before token refresh
